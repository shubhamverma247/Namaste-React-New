1: How do you create Nested Routes react-routerdom configuration?
We can create a `Nested Routes` inside a react router configuration as follows:
first call createBrowserRouter for routing different pages
const router = createBrowserRouter([
{
path: "/", // show path for routing
element: <Parent />, // show component for particular path
errorElement: <Error />, // show error component for path is different
children: [ // show children component for routing
{
path: "/path",
element: <Child />
}
],
}
])
Now we can create a nested routing for  /path  using  children  again as follows:
const router = createBrowserRouter([
{
path: "/",
element: <Parent />,
errorElement: <Error />,
children: [
{
path: "/about",
element: <About />,
Assignment 08 - Let's get Classy 2
children: [
{
path: "profile", // // nested routing for subchild
element: <Profile />,
},
],
}
],
}
])

2: Read about createHashRouter , createMemoryRouter from
React Router docs.
createHashRouter  is useful if you are unable to configure your web server to direct all
traffic to your React Router application. Instead of using normal URLs, it will use
the  hash (#)  portion of the URL to manage the "application URL". Other than that, it is
functionally the same as  createBrowserRouter .
createMemoryRouter  Instead of using the browsers history a memory router manages it's
own history stack in memory. It's primarily useful for testing and component
development tools like Storybook, but can also be used for running React Router in any
non-browser environment.
3: What is the order of life cycle method calls in Class
Based Components ?
Following is the order of lifecycle methods calls in  Class Based Components :
1. constructor()
2. render ()
3. componentDidMount()
4. componentDidUpdate()
5. componentWillUnmount()
For more reference: React-Lifecycle-methods-Diagram
Explanation:-
Assignment 08 - Let's get Classy 3
Class based components are executed in two phases : Render phase & commit
phase.
Render phase is pure and no side effects. It may be paused, restarted or aborted by
React (when child component is created for eg). The constructor(), render() and
componentDidMount() happens in this phase.
In constructor, the props are passed to its parents.
These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component
is being created and inserted into the DOM:
Mounting :
1. constructor - The constructor for a React component is called before it is
mounted. When implementing the constructor for a React.Component subclass,
you should call super(props) before any other statement. Otherwise, this.props
will be undefined in the constructor, which can lead to bugs.
Initializing local state by assigning an object to this.state
Binding event handler methods to an instance.
Constructor is the only place where you should assign this.state directly. In all other
methods, you need to use this.setState() instead.
1. componentDidMount() - componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a
component is mounted (inserted into the tree). You may call setState()
immediately in componentDidMount() so that it triggers re-render before the
browser updates the screen.
Updating : 3. componentDidUpdate() - componentDidUpdate() is invoked
immediately after updating occurs. This method is not called for the initial render.
Unmounting : 4. componentWillUnmount() -componentWillUnmount() is invoked
immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. Perform any
necessary cleanup in this method, such as invalidating timers, canceling network
requests, or cleaning up any subscriptions that were created in
componentDidMount().

4: Why do we use componentDidMount ?
Assignment 08 - Let's get Classy 4
componentDidMount - In CBC it is the best place to make an API call.Like we make an api
call inside useEffect in functional component .Bcz intially react first finishes the render()
Phase and it updates the DOM ,Then it make an API call(it need to load some data).So
it takes some time to load and also we use  componentDidMount  as a  async function so it
delays the component to print.It is called after intial or every render. Example:
async componentDidMount() {
//This is the best place we make an API call
const data = await fetch("https://api.github.com/users/sam-0905");
const json = await data.json();s
this.setState({
userInfo: json,
});
console.log("userInfo", json);
console.log("componentDidMount");
}
5: Why do we use componentWillUnmount ? Show

with example .
componentWillUnmount  is useful for the cleanup of the application when we switch routes
from one place to another. Since we are working with a SPA the component process
always runs in the background even if we switch to another route.So it is required to
stop those processes before leaving the page. If we revisit the same page, a new
process starts that affects the browser performance.
For example, in Repo class, during componentDidMount() a timer is set with an interval
of every one second to print in console. When the component is unmounted (users
moves to a different page), the timer will be running in the background, which we might
not even realise and causing huge performance issue. To avoid such situations the
cleanup function can be done in componentWillUnmount, in this example
clearInterval (timer) to clear the timer interval before unmounting Repo component.
6: (Research) Why do we
use super(props) in constructor ?
super(props)  is used to inherit the properties and access of variables of the React parent
class when we initialize our component.
Assignment 08 - Let's get Classy 5
super() is used inside constructor of a class to derive the parent's all properties inside
the class that extended it. If super() is not used, then  Reference Error : Must call super
constructor in derived classes before accessing 'this' or returning from derived
constructor  is thrown in the console.
A component that extends  React.Component  must call the  super()  constructor in the
derived class since itâ€™s required to access this context inside the derived class
constructor.
When you try to use props passed on parent to child component in child component
using  this.props.name , it will still work without super(props). Only super() is also enought
for accessing props in render method.
The main difference between super() and super(props) is the this.props is undefined in
child's constructor in super() but this.props contains the passed props if super(props) is
used.
7: (Research) Why can't we have the callback

function of useEffect async ?
useEffect  expects it's callback function to return nothing or return a function (cleanup
function that is called when the component is unmounted). If we make the callback
function as  async , it will return a  promise  and the promise will affect the clean-up
function from being called.
Solution to this is not making the callback function async but created another async
function inside callback function of useEffect().
